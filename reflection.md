- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At first, Encapsulation was frustrating because I had to think about which variables and methods should be public or private. However, as I worked through the train project, I strated to see how it helps organize the program. Each class had its own responsibility, and that made the overall structure clearer. 

Moreover, misspelling a method name or using the wrong return type, caused my program to not compile. It made me realize how precise Java is and how carefully I need to match interfaces exactly. My advise for future students is to read error messages carefully and double-check method names and return types. Small details matter a lot in Java.
